## Objective
This project is a solo effort designed to demonstrate my proficiency in AI API integration and web app design.

The page utilizes React and Material-UI for a visually engaging and responsive design, incorporating a dark theme with complementary color accents to enhance user experience. Additionally, the project integrates a testimonials carousel with Slick Carousel to display user feedback attractively. This application not only emphasizes seamless AI interaction but also highlights advanced UI design, ensuring an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface for end-users.
